Coding Challenge:

Develop R code to simulate a Lotka-volterra predator-prey system. Use forward Euler 
integration, which is basically a for-loop, to simulate changes in the predator and prey
populations over time. Save population time series as separate csv files. Then develop a
separate R-script for plotting these time series. Save these plots as PNG figures.
Create a GitHub repo for this coding challenge, and make the README.md, and embed these
figures. Try to include a description of the equations that you just solvfed using R.

- practice using collaborative digital infrastructure (drive, core docs, schedule, 
meeting, roles and responsibilities, collaborative coding).

- co-develop a GitHub repo
